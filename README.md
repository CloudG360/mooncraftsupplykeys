# Mooncraft SupplyKeys

This project was made for Sponge API 7 which introduced crates based off proprietary "lootpools" which are basically an inferior version on Minecraft's native "Loot Table" system as, at the time, it wasn't exposed in the Sponge API.

The crates themselves would drop in the world when a key was used on a random block so the keys were more like summoning items. These summons would send out announcements to the whole server that a crate was dropping in a specific location

### Features included:
- Data-Driven loot
- Configuration for custom crates
- Announcements for drops


A few of the concepts from lootpools and serializableitems made their way into the [AstroItemLib](https://github.com/CloudG360/AstroItemLib) project.

Furthermore, this project is being archived as I have no interest in updating it and the current systems aren't up to my current standards. I feel some of the code is reusable so feel free to fork it.
